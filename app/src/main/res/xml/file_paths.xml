<!-- file_paths.xml - File provider paths configuration for the Finance Tracker app -->
<!-- 
This file defines which directories the FileProvider can access for secure file sharing.
It's used in conjunction with the FileProvider in AndroidManifest.xml to enable
CSV export functionality while maintaining security.

Security Benefits:
- Restricts file access to specific directories only
- Prevents unauthorized access to app's private files
- Enables secure sharing of exported data files

    <!-- Cache Directory Access -->
    <!-- 
    This path allows access to the app's cache directory where temporary files
    like exported CSV files are stored before sharing.
    
    Usage:
    - CSV export files are created in this directory
    - Files are shared via Intent.ACTION_SEND
    - Files are automatically cleaned up by the system
    - No user permission required for this directory

    <!-- External Cache Directory Access (Alternative) -->
    <!-- 
    This path provides access to external cache directory as a fallback
    for devices with limited internal storage.
    
    Note: This is commented out as we primarily use internal cache
    for better security and automatic cleanup.

    <!-- Files Directory Access (Optional) -->
    <!-- 
    This path could be used for persistent file storage if needed.
    Currently not used as we prefer cache directory for temporary exports.
